# Getting Started with Deep Learning Labs

## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

Welcome to the Deep Learning Lab collection! This guide will help you get started quickly.

## 📋 Prerequisites

- **Python 3.8 or higher**
- **pip** package manager
- **8GB RAM minimum** (16GB recommended)
- **GPU optional** (CUDA-compatible for faster training)

## 🔧 Installation

### Step 1: Clone or Download

If you haven't already, navigate to the `dl-lab` directory:
```bash
cd dl-lab
```

### Step 2: Create Virtual Environment (Recommended)

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies

```bash
# Install all required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install:
- PyTorch & TorchVision
- TensorFlow & Keras
- OpenCV
- scikit-learn
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- And more...

### Step 4: Verify Installation

```bash
python3 -c "import torch; print(f'PyTorch: {torch.__version__}')"
python3 -c "import cv2; print(f'OpenCV: {cv2.__version__}')"
```
